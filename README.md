# hello-jni-ndkbuild-cpp20

Up-to-date [hello-jni](https://github.com/android/ndk-samples) example that uses [ndk-build](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/android_mk) instead of cmake.

Made as a preparation to ditch cmake entirely for building [my mobile games](https://doomhowl-interactive.com). Modern C++ on Android with simple makefiles!
